# Ennard Interval Timer

## Just a fork to make the tool a little more user-friendly.

Requires Python to be installed to PATH.

- Batch file for ease of use, closes cmd window by default.
- Window will be always on top for streamers and one-monitor users.
- Window size has a set default to be space-minimal; maximize to see the text and ASCII dog.
- Additional comments for code readability

I was unsuccessful in trying to find a way to reset the timer via a keyboard shortcut. I'm not terribly well-versed in Python, forgive me.
